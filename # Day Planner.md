# Day Planner
Using HTML, CSS, and JS I have created a day planner in a browser.  It displays the current date and time as well as allows user to enter events for the hours in a typical work day.  When user enters events, that event is saved in local storage, so when browser is refreshed the event stays in place.

## Objectives

 - When user opens planner, the current day and time are displayed at the top of the screen.
 - When user scrolls down page, each out of the business day is made available to add events
 - Each time block is color coded to represent past, current, and future hours.
 - When event field is selected, user can enter an event they have at the given hour.
 - When user selects the save button, the event is saved into local storage.
 - If user refreshed page, the event they previously entered will still be available in their time slot.
